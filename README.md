# Unit Conversion Web Application

A simple and intuitive web application for converting between different units of measurement. This project demonstrates HTML5 semantic elements and provides a clean interface for temperature, weight, and distance conversions.

## 🌟 Features

### Temperature Conversion
- Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit
- Interactive input field for temperature values
- **Working conversion** with real-time calculations
- Formula: (C × 9/5) + 32

### Weight Conversion
- Convert Kilograms to Pounds
- User-friendly input/output interface
- **Functional conversion** with instant results
- Formula: kg × 2.2

### Distance Conversion
- Convert Kilometers to Miles
- Clean and simple conversion interface
- **Live conversion** with accurate calculations
- Formula: km × 0.62137

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- No additional dependencies required

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/unit_conversion.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd unit_conversion
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your web browser:
   - Double-click the file, or
   - Right-click and select "Open with" → your preferred browser, or
   - Use a local server (optional)

## 📖 How to Use

1. **Navigate to a conversion section** using the navigation buttons at the top:
   - Temperature
   - Weight
   - Distance

2. **Enter a value** in the input field for the unit you want to convert from

3. **Click the "Convert" button** to see the result in the output field

4. **Use the home button** (🏠) to return to the top of the page

## 🏗️ Project Structure

```

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** - Semantic elements and structure
- **CSS3** - External stylesheet with modern styling features
- **JavaScript** - Interactive conversion logic with real-time calculations

## 📋 HTML5 Elements Demonstrated

- `<section>` - Content sections for different conversion types
- `<nav>` - Navigation between conversion sections
- `<article>` - Self-contained conversion forms
- `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` - Form grouping and labeling
- `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` - Image and caption display
- `<aside>` - Additional information and formulas
- `<footer>` - Page footer information

## 🎨 Styling Features

- **Modern Design** - Clean, professional layout with grid-based structure
- **Color-coded Sections** - Each conversion type has a unique border color (green, coral, cyan)
- **Responsive Layout** - Grid system that adapts to different screen sizes
- **Interactive Elements** - Hover effects on buttons and navigation
- **Visual Hierarchy** - Clear typography and spacing for better readability
- **Fixed Home Button** - Floating home button for easy navigation
- **Professional Color Scheme** - Dark header with purple gradient and white content areas

## 🔧 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Implement reverse conversions (Fahrenheit to Celsius, etc.)
- [ ] Add more unit types (area, volume, time)
- [ ] Add input validation and error handling
- [ ] Implement keyboard shortcuts for better accessibility
- [ ] Add dark/light theme toggle
- [ ] Add animation transitions for smoother user experience
- [ ] Add conversion history feature
- [ ] Implement decimal precision controls

## 📝 Conversion Formulas

| Conversion Type | Formula |
|----------------|---------|
| Celsius to Fahrenheit | (C × 9/5) + 32 |
| Kilograms to Pounds | kg × 2.2 |
| Kilometers to Miles | km × 0.62137 |
