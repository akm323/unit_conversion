# Unit Conversion Web Application

A simple and intuitive web application for converting between different units of measurement. This project demonstrates HTML5 semantic elements and provides a clean interface for temperature, weight, and distance conversions.

## 🌟 Features

### Temperature Conversion
- Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit
- Interactive input field for temperature values
- Real-time conversion with the click of a button
- Formula reference: (C × 9/5) + 32

### Weight Conversion
- Convert Kilograms to Pounds
- User-friendly input/output interface
- Quick conversion functionality
- Formula reference: kg × 2.205

### Distance Conversion
- Convert Kilometers to Miles
- Clean and simple conversion interface
- Instant results
- Formula reference: km ÷ 1.609

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- No additional dependencies required

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/unit_conversion.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd unit_conversion
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your web browser:
   - Double-click the file, or
   - Right-click and select "Open with" → your preferred browser, or
   - Use a local server (optional)

## 📖 How to Use

1. **Navigate to a conversion section** using the navigation buttons at the top:
   - Temperature
   - Weight
   - Distance

2. **Enter a value** in the input field for the unit you want to convert from

3. **Click the "Convert" button** to see the result in the output field

4. **Use the home button** (🏠) to return to the top of the page

## 🏗️ Project Structure

```
unit_conversion/
├── index.html          # Main HTML file with all conversion functionality
└── README.md           # Project documentation
```

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** - Semantic elements and structure
- **CSS** - Styling (embedded in HTML)
- **JavaScript** - Conversion logic (to be implemented)

## 📋 HTML5 Elements Demonstrated

- `<section>` - Content sections for different conversion types
- `<nav>` - Navigation between conversion sections
- `<article>` - Self-contained conversion forms
- `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` - Form grouping and labeling
- `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` - Image and caption display
- `<aside>` - Additional information and formulas
- `<footer>` - Page footer information

## 🔧 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add JavaScript functionality for actual conversions
- [ ] Implement reverse conversions (Fahrenheit to Celsius, etc.)
- [ ] Add more unit types (area, volume, time)
- [ ] Improve responsive design for mobile devices
- [ ] Add input validation and error handling
- [ ] Implement keyboard shortcuts for better accessibility

## 📝 Conversion Formulas

|----------------|---------|
| Celsius to Fahrenheit | (C × 9/5) + 32 |
| Kilograms to Pounds | kg × 2.205 |
| Kilometers to Miles | km ÷ 1.609 |
